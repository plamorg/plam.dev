                <h3 class="text-xl max-w-3xl font-serif mb-2">We design and build software from the ground-up with a focus on clean design and intuitive interactions.</h3>
                <p class="text-sm my-2">We're a team of passionate, multi-disciplinary students who strive to engineer well-designed, reliable software. We're hackers at heart, excited to explore any new ideas we generate.</p>
                <p class="text-sm my-2">Previously, we've developed online educational platforms for organisations such as UFDS and DOVERMUN. Collectively, these platforms help over 1,000 students to learn and engage effectively. We've contributed to the open-source ecosystem through projects such as ambit, a Linux dotfile manager. We've also won several hackathon awards, such as Best Pre-University Hack from NUS Hack&Roll 2 years in a row.</p>
                <p class="text-sm my-2">We're always excited to take on new projects. Get in touch with us at <a class="underline" href="mailto:hello@plam.dev">hello@plam.dev</a>!</p>
